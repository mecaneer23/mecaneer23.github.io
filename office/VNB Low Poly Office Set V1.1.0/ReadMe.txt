 - Updated textures: added a fourth painting texture, a new board texture, and modified some of the existing ones (including some palettes)

The aim for this package is to just set-up things quickly, by providing ready-to-use prefabs of everything. This includes:

- Materials and original palette (6 palettes you can always modify or expand). (if you're using URP, then you will need to convert these to URP, this is done with literally just one click from within Unity)
- Prefabs of models ready to place in scene, ready to be animated or manipulated from script (some are actual ready-to-use compositions of models).

*Make sure to snap things to the grid when using tiles*

*Look at my itch.io page for details*

Este package contiene prefabs listos para usar, haciendolo todo mucho mas fácil:

- Materiales y paleta de colores listos para usar (6 paletas incluidas, puedes modificarlas o crear nuevas a partir de estas). (Si utilizas URP, deberás convertir los materiales a URP, esto se hace directamente desde Unity)
- Prefabs y modelos listos para arrastrar a escena y animarlos o manipularlos mediante scripting (algunos formados por multiples sub-modelos, listos para su uso).

*Asegúrate de activar el snapping al utilizar las tiles*

--- Description ---

Following another challenge, I decided to create an office set (taking inspiration originally from the same person from the previous park set), this time I decided to come up with a bigger set containing even more stuff to tweak and use in order to populate some office-like scenario, and coming with some different palettes in order to provide more variation, and a modular-like way of creating furniture (no, there are no more models in Unity that the ones and amount I listed, it's the illusion of palettes and modular building lol).

You may find some important things missing, in which case I encourage you to tell me on my itch.io page, so I can update the set with more models!

You're free to use every model the way you want for any commercial / non-commercial project. (comments and mentions are always welcome and certainly appreciated)

I shouldn't really need to clarify this, but just in case, remember you're not able to re-sell these models individually or as part of a model pack.

Please make sure to review the asset on itch.io if you found it useful, leave a comment there, along with any kind of suggestion (or problem you faced while using it) in order to improve it!

[Notes]
* Some models may contain a second material, used to add more variation to certain parts of the model itself.
