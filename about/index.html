                Hi, my name is Gabriel Natenshon and I am a high school student who loves learning, teaching, and all
                things tech. I value perseverance as a personality trait and I'm always up for a challenge.
                Recently, I took a <a href="https://github.com/mecaneer23/BinarytoDecimal">simple concept</a> and
                programmed my own algorithm in over 50 languages. I've published many of my personal projects on
                <a href="https://github.com/mecaneer23">GitHub</a>, providing a learning tool for my direct students
                as well as for any other interested individuals. When I'm not exploring different programming languages,
                learning about the latest tech advancements, or teaching others how to code, I like to spend my time
                working on robotics projects, playing trumpet in various ensembles, and competing in gymnastics.
                My goal is to optimize my life and happiness by learning to use my tools effectively.
