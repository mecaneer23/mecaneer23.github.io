                Hi, my name is Gabriel Natenshon, and I am a high school student who loves learning, teaching, and all
                things tech. I value perseverance as a personality trait, and I'm always up for a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've published many of my personal projects on
                <a href="https://github.com/mecaneer23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, providing
                a learning tool for my direct students as well as for any other interested individuals. I'm passionate
                about helping individuals achieve their hardware and software goals
                through technical assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not exploring different programming languages, learning about the latest tech advancements, or
                teaching others how to code, I like to spend my time working on robotics projects, playing trumpet in
                various ensembles, and competing in gymnastics.
            </p>
